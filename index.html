                                <p>This topic sentence is one that I think is particularly effective, as it includes a claim introducing an idea not immediately apparent through the story. Additionally, the comparison between tourism and early colonization shows the severity of the issues present in the story, which can be elaborated in more detail later in the analysis.</p>

                                Even though Antigua is no longer under British rule, Kincaid shows that the colonization of Antigua by the British is kept alive through rampant American and European tourism.

                                    This body paragraph was one that I genuinely enjoyed writing, as it goes in great detail as to specific events and language used in the story. Writing these types of paragraphs in essays was actually quite exciting, as it deviates from the formulaic high-school writing techniques, and instead focuses on introducing ideas to the reader in a natural flow.

                                    The only shift that has been made in the colonization from the British period to now is the source: the tourists are now the colonists visiting and taking over desirable aspects of the island, and the Antiguans are the natives that continue to be exploited through such foreign affairs. This is addressed near the end of the story, where Kincaid relates the beauty and overwhelming nature of Antigua as if it were a “prison, and as if everything and everybody inside it were locked in and everything and everybody that is not inside it were locked out” (Kincaid, 79). The relation between these two objects, a paradise and a prison, shows what native Antiguans truly believe about colonial ideas and tourism. Areas that are designated for tourists, like the beach, prohibit native Antiguans from entering. Just as the British colonists took over Antiguan land and took the natives as slaves, the tourism industry has claimed the land for tourist use. The library that was destroyed in an earthquake has yet to be rebuilt, depriving Antiguans of knowledge while being a tourist attraction for colonial history and entertainment among the tourists. This ignorance matches that of the colonists, where no genuine history or culture is acknowledged. Literally, Antiguans are locked out of going to beaches and acquiring knowledge. On a larger scale, Antigua as a whole is imprisoned to other countries due to its isolated nature and the control other countries explicitly have in Antigua. This leaves Antiguans with no control of their land, resources, or themselves, as they have all become mere props for the white tourists.

                                    Thesis (introduction) paragraphs ended up being a bit tough for me&mdash;especially this one. For this essay, I used the American Dream, a term attributed to living a prosperous life through equal opportunities, as a theoretical model to emphasize the control that the State (the New Imperial Order) has over the ResLifers' and Tecos' lives (the lower class). Although I feel that this comparison is valid, it definitely added a lot more (maybe unnecessary) complexity to the essay. My main takeaway from writing this paragraph is to not try and cram too much information into the introduction, but rather give a short summary by providing a few key points in the introduction, then give more detail in the body paragraphs.

                                    Rosaura Sánchez and Beatrice Pita&apos;s book, <i>Lunar Braceros 2125-2148</i>, depicts the lives
                                    of Lydia, Frank, and their friends, who are dehumanized and exploited for labor by a futuristic
                                    and divided United States. Through a series of fragmented memoirs collected by Lydia from a
                                    multitude of voices throughout the text, people share their stories of being sent to Reservations or
                                    becoming &quot;Tecos.&quot; Situated in Cali-Texas, a political entity formed by the New Imperial Order
                                    (the State) after &quot;The Great Political Restructuring,&quot; Lydia describes her transition from being
                                    forced into Reservations to working as a Teco herself. Although the story does not take place
                                    solely in the United States, the idea of pursuing a prosperous life similar to that of the American
                                    Dream remains relevant throughout the text. The book emphasizes the negative impact that
                                    forced labor and alienating social hierarchies can have on the lower class population,
                                    highlighting the oppression and exploitation that the lower class must endure to achieve a
                                    nonexistent &quot;American Dream.&quot;

                                    as it foreshadows the main character's (Memo's) fate in the movie.

                                    is given privileges in society.

                                    Dear Adam in the future,<br>

                                    This comparative literature R1A class has been an <strong>outstanding experience</strong>! I have learned a lot about
                                    various techniques for structuring my writing, like using the "<u>T</u>opic <u>S</u>entence, <u>E</u>vidence, <u>A</u>nalysis"
                                    approach for a body paragraph or making <strong>reverse outlines</strong>.
                                    It has definitely been tough breaking free from the high-school writing conventions, but now after completing a few writing
                                    projects in the course, I find that I can now write more effectively and actually enjoy writing a lot more.
                                    The analysis portion of writing (which is pretty much the main part) is what was absent from that type of writing in high
                                    school, and looking back at my essays, I can see many areas of which I could have improved my arguments.
                                    The #1 advice that I would give is to <strong>not overthink things</strong>, and to try your best to
                                    <strong>not procrastinate</strong>! It only adds more unnecessary stress, and forces you to rush through
                                    assignments and projects. I found myself doing that a bit during this class, and had to make a to-do list
                                    to help organize my priorities (which led to having a bit of free time). Also, don't spend too much time trying to make
                                    everything absolutely perfect the first time around, that's what drafts are for! Anyways, don't stress out too much about
                                    the second R&C requirement, because you will do great!<br>
