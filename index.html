                    <p>This topic sentence is one that I think is particularly effective, as it includes a claim introducing an idea not immediately apparent through the story. Additionally, the comparison between tourism and early colonization shows the severity of the issues present in the story, which can be elaborated in more detail later in the analysis.</p>

                        This body paragraph was one that I genuinely enjoyed writing, as it goes in great detail as to specific events and language used in the story. Writing these types of paragraphs in essays was actually quite exciting, as it deviates from the formulaic high-school writing techniques, and instead focuses on introducing ideas to the reader in a natural flow.

                            The only shift that has been made in the colonization from the British period to now is the source: the tourists are now the colonists visiting and taking over desirable aspects of the island, and the Antiguans are the natives that continue to be exploited through such foreign affairs. This is addressed near the end of the story, where Kincaid relates the beauty and overwhelming nature of Antigua as if it were a “prison, and as if everything and everybody inside it were locked in and everything and everybody that is not inside it were locked out” (Kincaid, 79). The relation between these two objects, a paradise and a prison, shows what native Antiguans truly believe about colonial ideas and tourism. Areas that are designated for tourists, like the beach, prohibit native Antiguans from entering. Just as the British colonists took over Antiguan land and took the natives as slaves, the tourism industry has claimed the land for tourist use. The library that was destroyed in an earthquake has yet to be rebuilt, depriving Antiguans of knowledge while being a tourist attraction for colonial history and entertainment among the tourists. This ignorance matches that of the colonists, where no genuine history or culture is acknowledged. Literally, Antiguans are locked out of going to beaches and acquiring knowledge. On a larger scale, Antigua as a whole is imprisoned to other countries due to its isolated nature and the control other countries explicitly have in Antigua. This leaves Antiguans with no control of their land, resources, or themselves, as they have all become mere props for the white tourists.

                        Thesis (introduction) paragraphs ended up being a bit tough for me&mdash;especially this one. For this essay, I used the American Dream, a term attributed to living a prosperous life through equal opportunities, as a theoretical model to emphasize the control that the State (the New Imperial Order) has over the ResLifers' and Tecos' lives (the lower class). Although I feel that this comparison is valid, it definitely added a lot more (maybe unnecessary) complexity to the essay. My main takeaway from writing this paragraph is to not try and cram too much information into the introduction, but rather give a short summary by providing a few key points in the introduction, then give more detail in the body paragraphs.

                            Rosaura Sánchez and Beatrice Pita&apos;s book, <i>Lunar Braceros 2125-2148</i>, depicts the lives
                            of Lydia, Frank, and their friends, who are dehumanized and exploited for labor by a futuristic
                            and divided United States. Through a series of fragmented memoirs collected by Lydia from a
                            multitude of voices throughout the text, people share their stories of being sent to Reservations or
                            becoming &quot;Tecos.&quot; Situated in Cali-Texas, a political entity formed by the New Imperial Order
                            (the State) after &quot;The Great Political Restructuring,&quot; Lydia describes her transition from being
                            forced into Reservations to working as a Teco herself. Although the story does not take place
                            solely in the United States, the idea of pursuing a prosperous life similar to that of the American
                            Dream remains relevant throughout the text. The book emphasizes the negative impact that
                            forced labor and alienating social hierarchies can have on the lower class population,
                            highlighting the oppression and exploitation that the lower class must endure to achieve a
                            nonexistent &quot;American Dream.&quot;
