                    <p>This topic sentence is one that I think is particularly effective, as it includes a claim introducing an idea not immediately apparent through the story. Additionally, the comparison between tourism and early colonization shows the severity of the issues present in the story, which can be elaborated in more detail later in the analysis.</p>

                        Even though Antigua is no longer under British rule, Kincaid shows that the colonization of Antigua by the British is kept alive through rampant American and European tourism.

                    <p>This body paragraph was one that I enjoyed writing, as it goes in great detail as to specific events and language used in the story. Writing these types of paragraphs in essays was actually quite exciting, as it deviates from the formulaic high-school writing techniques, and focuses on introducing ideas to the reader in a natural flow. </p>

                        &Tab;Through oppressive outside financial influences in Antigua, countries all around the world have deprived Antiguans of true financial independence. This is emphasized when Kincaid mentions that Antiguans are usually held up at customs for “returning to Antigua from Europe or North America with cardboard boxes of much needed cheap clothes and food for relatives” (Kincaid, 4). The specific inclusion of this detail showcases the fragility of the Antiguan economic system, where natives are unable to attain enough money to buy clothes or food to sustain themselves. In contrast, American and European tourists enjoy the low prices of goods in Antigua. This class difference hints that the majority of the Antiguan population lives in poverty and that the few residents who have been described as being wealthy, like the rich foreign merchants living in mansions, have built up their wealth through foreign affairs. Additionally, Antigua continues to be exploited by foreign countries for its resources, depriving them of tradeable goods. One such example of this is when Kincaid states that “it’s better that you don’t know that most of what you are eating came off a plane from Miami […] [a] good guess is that it came from a place like Antigua first, where it was grown dirt-cheap, went to Miami, and came back” (Kincaid, 14). This behavior of trade appears to be a reference to exporters in Antigua, where a special (and presumably valuable) type of lobster is grown there for monetary gain. This is yet another example of potentially disastrous exploitation of Antigua, as it deprives native Antiguans of a food source. Considering the poverty-stricken Antiguan population, the majority of those who would be consuming lobster in Antigua are tourists. Because of this, Antiguans are forced into searching internationally for other food sources, where they still must have money to purchase these goods. Despite this fact, the white tourists continue to perceive themselves as being more successful than Antiguans. This demonstrates that there is still a sense of foreign leadership in Antigua and that native Antiguans have never truly had the opportunity to build a proper foundation for the country.
